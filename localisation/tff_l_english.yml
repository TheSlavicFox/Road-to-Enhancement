 tff.1.t:0 "The Fuehrer's Fate"
 tff.1.d:0 "For three years now, Adolf Hitler has been steering the fortunes of the German Reich as "Führer und Reichskanzler". During this time, the already extremely popular "Führer" distinguished himself further by getting the actually damned economy of the Reich running again and thus giving many Germans back their existence. Through merits like these, a kind of cult arose around Hitler, which revered him as something godlike and stood by him no matter what might happen. This "Führermythos" quickly encompassed large parts of the German people, making Hitler someone many Germans could no longer imagine living without.\n\nBut like so many things, Hitler's life came to an end. Today, the much beloved "Führer und Reichskanzler" died in his official residence, the new Reich Chancellery. This death is not surprising. Hitler's health had deteriorated considerably in the last few months, which led many to suspect that he would probably die. However, very few people wanted to believe it.\n\nNow that the "Führer" is dead and the people are in mourning, his potential successors are naturally getting into position. But who is to follow in Hitler's great footsteps?  Who should lead the German people into a glorious future?"

 tff.11.t:0 "The Fanatic"
 tff.11.d:0 "After graduating from high school, Steiner joined the Prussian army in March 1914 and experienced World War I as an officer mostly on the eastern front in the assault battalions, elite units that represented something completely new in the tactical field from 1917. After participating in Freikorp fights in his East Prussian homeland in 1919, he was accepted into the Reichswehr. Shortly after the Nazis came to power, Steiner left the Reichswehr with the rank of major.\n\nSteiner joined the NSDAP in 1933, was a member of the SA from Jan. 1934, and transferred to the SS in 1935. As commander of the "Deutschland" regiment in the SS Verfügungstruppe, he trained his unit according to the tactical principles of World War I assault battalions. The emphasis was on personality formation and physical training. Steiner wanted to create an elitist type of soldier, although it is still unclear to what extent he deliberately indoctrinated his soldiers in the spirit of Nazi ideology. Steiner's impulses, however, never became commonplace in the military training of the Waffen-SS, but were always limited to the units and formations he led."

 tff.12.d:0 "Karl Dönitz came from Berlin and was the son of an engineer. He joined the Imperial Navy as a cadet in 1910 and became a lieutenant at sea in 1912. At the beginning of World War I, he served on the small cruiser "Breslau," which, together with the battle cruiser "Goeben," succeeded in breaking through the Mediterranean to Turkey in 1914. In 1916, D. transferred to the submarine force and, as commander, engaged in merchant warfare in the Mediterranean and Atlantic until he was taken prisoner by the British on Oct. 4, 1918.\n\nAfter his release, he remained in the Reichsmarine of the Republic and was, among other things, torpedo boat half-flotilla commander for a long time. In 1934, he commanded the school cruiser "Emden." In July 1935, as a captain at sea, he took command of the submarine flotilla "Weddigen", which was to be newly established."

After graduating from the Joachimsthalisches Gymnasium in Berlin, he joined the Foot Artillery Regiment No. 1 in 1910. On July 1, 1915, he was assigned to the Fliegertruppe, where he initially served as an observer on the Western Front. After the war he was temporarily assigned as a general staff officer with the XVII AK in Danzig and later as a captain and leader of a border guard aviation division. For a short time he also studied at the University of Königsberg and the TH Danzig.\n\nWhen a German aviation force was banned by the peace treaty in 1920, Milch took his leave and, in civil aviation, took over the flight and route management of Lloyd Ostflug GmbH in Gdansk. At the same time, he became managing director of Danziger Luftpost GmbH. From 1921 to 1923, he played a major role in the establishment of the Lithuanian, Latvian, Swiss, Swedish, Polish, Austrian and Hungarian air transport services on behalf of Junkers Luftverkehr AG, which had emerged from Lloyd Ostflug GmbH..."

 POLITICS_HEINRICH_HIMMLER_DESC:0 "Heinrich Himmler was born in Munich on October 7, 1900. There he participated in the failed Hitler putsch in 1923 as a member of a right-wing extremist military association. In 1925 he joined the NSDAP, served as deputy head of propaganda from 1926 to 1930, and was appointed "Reichsführer SS" in January 1929. Himmler developed the SS into an efficient inner-party police force. His top maxim in personnel selection and management was always his racist ideas, which soon determined the spirit of the SS. In 1933 Himmler became police chief of Munich and from then on organized the Political Police in Bavaria. In April 1934, Hermann Göring appointed him deputy head of the Prussian Gestapo, of which Reinhard Heydrich became head.\n\nHimmler was instrumental in the assassination of prominent SA members after the so-called Röhm Putsch - on June 30/July 1, 1934. Subsequently, he succeeded in having the SS separated from the SA and made into an independent organization within the NSDAP. The task of the SS now became, among other things, the organization and guarding of the concentration camps that had been built since 1933. In 1936 Himmler became Reichsführer SS and Chief of Police and was now able to merge the two security apparatuses, the state and the party. A comprehensive system of surveillance and terror was thus created."
